# Fake-news-detection
Developed a machine learning model to identify fake news by training on a labeled dataset of articles, utilizing techniques like TF-IDF for feature extraction and logistic regression for classification.
Implemented NLP methods, including tokenization and stop-word removal, to preprocess and clean the data, ensuring high accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake news.
Employed cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis to rigorously test and fine-tune the model, achieving up to 99.71% accuracy.
